- How is the application -> incubation -> TLP process going. Changing PRs/issues/etc.
- Report on Active Applications:
	- ISIS (@victoronline mentor)
	- PlanetaryPy (@jessemapel mentor)
- Proposal to reduce the number of approvals required on PRs for Meeting Notes and Agenda from 2 to 1 (@rbeyer)
- Seeking Guidance on mixed-code project structure (@rbeyer)
	- For a mixed-code project which consists of primarily C++ code and user-level programs, but also contains some Python, what is the best way to structure it, both in terms of the physical lay-out in the repo, but also what build, distribution, and installation patterns would be best? Admittedly, I'm asking for ASP (which does not currently have a good solution), but this could also be applicable to ISIS or other large projects.

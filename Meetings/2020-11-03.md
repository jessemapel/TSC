- Report on Active Applications:
	- ISIS (@victoronline mentor)
        - In incubation
		- Kakadu licensing is a concern
			- Does this text cover third party dependencies?
				- We would have to go through all third party dependencies
				- Not a really sane approach
			- Kakadu is available for development, but not open source
			- If a package has proprietary dependencies, then it should run without that dependency
				- Minus any functionality provided by that dependency
		- Code of Conduct link is dead
			- Going to move to TSC code of conduct
		- Working to re-think release cadence
			- Lacking user input
	- PlanetaryPy (@jessemapel mentor)
	    - Ready for review to graduate from incubation
		- [Issue #112](https://github.com/planetarysoftware/TSC/issues/112)
		- Pvl considering reading SPICE text kernels
		    - Slightly too different from PVL
			- Implementing as a new package that uses PVL
		- Package template
		- Working on a PDS catalogue indexer
		- Packaging little scripts for everyday science use
		- Working to get started before advertising for more people

- Meeting time change conflicts with OpenPlanetary talks
    - move an hour earlier
	- will eventually conflict with OpenPlanetary in the spring, but we'll deal with that then
	- OpenPlanetary may move

- What's next for the TSC?
	- Punt until full attendence

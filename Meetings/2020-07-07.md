## Agenda / Notes
- Action Items from last time:
	- All: if you want to collaborate on OpenPlanetary Lunch Talk Slides, contact Jesse.
	- When @jessemapel can get back to his office machine, he will PR the meeting notes from March 2020.
	- @michaelaye will make a PR to [Contributing Document](https://github.com/planetarysoftware/TSC/blob/master/Contributing.md) to encourage clean-up of patch branches.
	- @jessemapel will make an Incubation Issue Template, which should have the checklist for graduating from Incubation, and such an Issue will serve as the 'tracking' document for each project in incubation.
	- Done: PR [#97](https://github.com/planetarysoftware/TSC/pull/97) merged to update the number of approvals needed for Meeting Notes and Agenda Items from 2 to 1.

- Report on Active Applications:

	- ISIS (@victoronline mentor)
	- PlanetaryPy (@jessemapel mentor)

- Seeking Guidance on small-dev-count volunteer projects (@rbeyer)
	- With a 2-approval PR system, and 3 or 4 developers, everybody must be active on
	  every PR (or nearly so).
	- Volunteers can get easily pulled away to other tasks, and with a small head-count,
	  this has the practical effect of freezing development.
	- Drop to a 1-approval system?
	- Require 2-approvals to merge in the first *time period* (week, month, whatever), and
	  then after *time period* only require 1?
	- Or is the 2-approval system so important that it shouldn't be short-circuited?


## Discussions expected at next meeting, 2020 August 4 @ 12PM MST?

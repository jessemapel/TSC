# Community Contributing Guide for the *[insert TLP or TLWG name]*

*option 1*

The [Planetary Software Organization Community Contributing Guide][Contributing]
applies to this *[TLP or TLWG name]*.

*option 2*

*Define your own Contributing Guide, be mindful of the guidelines in
the Planetary Software [Lifecycle 
Document](https://github.com/planetarysoftware/TSC/blob/master/Lifecycle.md).*

*One aspect that you might wish to tune for your project are the
conditions for merging a PR.  The model in the [PSO Contributing
Document][Contributing] requires two approvals before it can be
merged, which means that three different human beings are involved
in every merge (the author, and two reviewers).  This model works
well for larger projects, or those that want lots of participation
by developers.  However, for smaller projects, where three people
represent a significant fraction of the active participants, this model
can impede progress.*

*An alternative would be to require only a single approval.  An alternate
strategy is to set a timeframe.  If there are no approvals or discussion
within the specified timeframe, then the PR can get merged.*

*What model you choose for your project is largely a function of what you
think will work best for your devleopment model.  If you're not sure, pick
one, and then change it if it isn't working out.*


*Regardless of what option you take, you may wish to employ a
variation of the [Developer Certificate of
Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) in your PR templates.*
